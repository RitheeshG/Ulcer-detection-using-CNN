Ulcer Detection Using CNN

This project focuses on detecting ulcers in medical images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a small online dataset of 20 images, categorized into two classes — ulcer and normal.

The CNN automatically learns visual features from the images and classifies them to help identify ulcer-affected areas.
Users can upload any image, and the model predicts whether the tissue is normal or shows signs of ulcer.

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied effectively in medical image classification, even with limited data, and serves as a foundation for developing more advanced healthcare AI systems.
